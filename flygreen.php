		<p class="margin-top30">Usually, there exists an eco-friendly option of travelling to reduce your carbon footprint. Walking, biking are the most environment friendly travel means but it is not always possible to take these options. Using public transportation, car-pooling, taking the train can be a better way for travelling long distances but sometimes we are compelled to fly.</p>
		<p class="margin-top30">Flying is propelled by fossil fuels and it contributes to increasing greenhouse gases emissions in the atmosphere causing significant damage to our environment. To compensate this emission, Sustainable Nepal presents you an option of planting trees that will help in sequestering carbon dioxide emitted during your travel.</p>
		<div class="section-heading margin-top60">
			<h5>HOW MANY TREES TO PLANT?</h5>
		</div>
		<!--p class="margin-top30">One mile in flight creates a little over one pound of carbon dioxide per passenger. So if you fly from Kathmandu to Stockholm, which is 3792.83 miles - this will lead to emission of 3792.83 pounds of carbon dioxide by each passenger. In general, a tree can absorb as much as 48 pounds of carbon dioxide per year. So to compensate 3792.83 pounds of carbon dioxide 80 trees can be planted. </p>
